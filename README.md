You might have three questions which I am here to answer: 'What', 'Who', and 'Why'.

# *What* This Is
It all started when I learned what `'clone'` meant in GitHub. Basically it would allow me to sync files from my local hard drive to here. In other words, what direct changes I make on my computer then get's sent over here! Neat technology we have, thanks to GitHub and best of all it pretty much 'free'! Anyhow, here are some notes for you, ze visitor:

## Content Usage
Feel free to peek at the code, experiment, or use it for your own stuff. When you feel like you're copying *too much*, that's the time that you should let me know! My stuff is under a license, MIT License to be specific, which means you can port my stuff or something.

## See What's Behind ze Scenes
Some develepoer files will be available here. Like debug functions, for example. Or some `PROGRESS.txt` and notes to constantly remind myself of what to do next should I try to take a break first. Some add-on names can also be seen here, from which where they are born. Take a look at these concept files and perhaps give me some ideas beforehand when making content.

## Real-time Updates
You would be able to see me work on stuff early even before they are released. This could happen on a basis periodically or so. You will see this from the `'last commit'` or `'push'` I've made.

## Get early access
In addition to what's mentioned above, you can also download my stuff **early**, and test them out **right away**. I can't guarantee if it'll break your game or not, as obviously, you're getting a copy of a *work in progress* content. **So be sure to test them in a world that you don't really care about - or just create a new world.**

## Availability
Only unstable and unreleased content will become available here. Once a stable version is released, the said add-on will be temporarily become unavailable from this list. And will become available as soon as an unreleased change is made once again.

# *Who* Made This
I did. By the way, here's my socials:
- **Twitter:** [@r4isen1920](https://twitter.com/r4isen1920)
- **Discord:** `r4isen1920#4377`
- **Xbox Gamertag:**  `r4isen1920`

*I do not have an OnlyFans account. Thanks for asking.*

# *Why* Do This
I want content I make to become more accessible and by doing so will help contribute towards the community.
