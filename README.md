## What Is This

This repository is a compendium of my Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons. Here, you can check the source code of my publicly available Add-Ons over which you can download and tinker yourself.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please visit the particular repository for that Add-On. And make a pull request. While generally I do not seek help and solely produce my own Add-Ons all by myself, I appreciate the gesture nonetheless.
