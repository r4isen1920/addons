TO-DO:

  - add functionality for [Log Book] item

  - add new advancements/achievement
  - identifier starts from the last one, doesn't have to be re-ordered
  - gui completion checker will only happen ONCE they use [Log Book] item, and not every tab switch

  - legacy java achievements user interface needed.

  - do advancements GUI for the remaining tabs
  - re-use check functions to send unlocked advancements to the GUI
  - add "progress bars" for in-progress advancements
  - apply triggers for new advancements + hopefully all other remaining advancements

  - unsure if interactions such as scroll bars and hoverable buttons work the same way on elements rendered under the HUD screen -> update:
    > sure does. it works! `always_accepts_input` must be true. only works when mouse is present and can directly scroll through the scrollbox.
    > other HUD elements needs to be dynamically hidden as well. check shanewolf38's findings on how to achieve this
    > scroll panel can be scrolled using other input methods without having to have the scroll bar be visible.

  - npc interact will render the "default" values; the hud will render the "current" values
    > "default" values contains the lines, as well as advancements on unobtained states
    > "current" values will be rendered on top of the "default" state and will be fetched and carried onto UI using $title_text

  # the game is acting weird and does this "says" texts

  - do UI window connection with HUD and NPC INTERACT namespaces

  - add new UI that lists all advancements and achievements like java

  - convert all old title and actionbar texts triggers to chat
  - find a way to hide certain chat strings from `chat_screen.json`
  - add woosh in sound effect (play only when in high memory), and then a woosh out sound effect after it that is triggered automatically [connect the two sounds together in audacity | interval :: 5.5s]
