 - use new texture rendering methods: use uv mapping instead of seperate files
 
 - current NPC dialog runtime is unstable in multiplayer
 - tweak dialogue button offset for continue and cancel buttons
 - tweak nether/end_tp structure using an nbt editor to add tick delays
 - implement nether tp for Blazeborn
   * for first timers: teleport the player on a random location first while in the overworld and then, teleport them to the nether_tp structure
   * for when changing to a blazeborn: teleport the player as if they chose to become a blazeborn as they first joined
   * for when changing to a blazeborn, after they had already been a blazeborn once: teleport them back to the nether as usual; if they are already in the nether keep it as is
   * for when changing to a blazeborn, while in the end dimension: teleport them into the overworld, and then to the nether
   * for when changing to a non-blazeborn: teleport them back in the overworld, unless if they had already walked there once before
