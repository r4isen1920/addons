 # 1.16.100: try to avoid using animation controllers to run commands
 # use events through the item.json instead when the item is used (consumed or eaten)
 # hide compass items in creative inventory if possible
 # implement black compass
 ~~# remove lodestone block placement when setting a waypoint. create a custom waypoint block instead.~~
 

 - Beam connector: make it disc instead of box; reduce particle size a bit
 - Space connector: reduce radius to 0.6; change color to its respective compass waypoint; reduce height a bit
 - RGB beam connector: remove; show void_emitter particle instead
 - Fix light gray and gray beam connectors not showing up: check spelling
 - Add a particle that emits color depending on the color change of the waypoint
 - Add particle and sound effects when a compass is linked
 
 
 - Add player functions:
 
 [ Waypoint ]
 - Use the respective waypoint compass & stay still for at least 3 seconds to commence teleportation;
 - Teleportation takes longer the farther you are away from the waypoint (up to 60 seconds):
    a. within 126 blocks => 5 seconds
    b. within 256 blocks => 10 seconds
    c. within 1024 blocks => 20 seconds
    d. within 4096 blocks => 30 seconds
    e. 4097 blocks or higher => 60 seconds
 - Moving while the teleportation is commencing will cancel the entire process and you have to do it from the start once again.
 - Cancelling the process will have a 50% chance of destroying the compass.
 
 [ Compass of the Void ]
 - Obtained by combining a Dragon Head and a compass through crafting
 - Activate the compass' power by using it and waiting for 20 seconds and staying still;
 - Upon respawn, it will immediately take you to the place where you've last died;
 - Once teleported, the compass' power will fade away;
 - You cannot activate the Compass of the Void for yourself if another player in your world has the compass activated.
