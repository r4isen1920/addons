 - Remove the 'ore_locator' entities' passive abilities. Only spawn them when you sneak and hold, after which in a few seconds before they despawn, they will tag the player with 'Searching_[ORE]' respectively.
 - Make the player itself summon 'ore_trackers' only when there is a nearby 'ore_pinpointer' with the same name (e.g "COAL") of the ore the player is searching for.

 - Make the 'ore_trackers' last longer so that the particles reach the player
 * Summon the 'ore_trackers' from the player instead spawning it from the pinpointer
 * Reduce the amount of 'ore_trackers' summoned at a time
 
 - Tweak particles: show 'ore_identifiers' when holding the Ore Locator on its respective ore search tag
 * 'Ore Identifiers' will be displayed on top of your head, where the 'ore_trackers' are comming from
 
 - Tweak action button: teleport the 'changer_ore_locator' entities to the player for more precision and convenience
 * These entities will now be required to be 'summonable' to be able to use in command syntax, otherwise, we'll assign a name using the [.lang] and track them via their name instead.
 
 - Sound effects: add sound effects for 'ore_trackers' or for the 'ore_pinpointers' to help know the exact spot
 * 'Ore_pinpointers' will playsound a high-pitched alarm to its location for the next 10 seconds
 
 - Fix 'Wealthy Emerald' item
 * 'Village_hero' syntax
 
 - Good luck!

 - Change particles for different types of Ores
